Just the cable - you're supposed to have kept one of the 5 (15?) plugs you already had! Of course if you want fast charging then you will need to buy a 20W plug - but the cable IS compatible with 20W charging (don't take that for granted - there are cables, and then there are cables). Actually I think it works (I am not paid by Apple!) - only occasionally do I need to supercharge my phone (and never when I am in my bedroom with the 20W charger and cable) Big con. C3 to C3 cable only. Had to purchase plug, adapters and ear buds separately. It comes with the plug and cable.

Hello, the phone is EU version and it could work in all Europe mainland####[]
The camera on this phone is excellent as you can imagine! There's no video stabilization @ 4K 30fps, but there's a steady mode you can use at that resolution that does the job, as long as you're not sprinting obviously!? ? I also have the gcam app for this device from XDA, the photo's are magnificent using it, but it's down to you to tinker and choose your favourite settings! ?? FYI: Slow motion doesn't work with the gcam app on this device, regardless of the version, it crashes the app!

Be prepared, this phone is very heavy and will certainly weigh your pocket down. Battery life is excellent. It won't win any beauty contests, but I did not buy it as a fashion icon. Feels very strong and well built. Power button on side is easily pressed in pocket etc. Downside is the security issues with Android 10 - Even when the phone is locket with a PIN it can be turned off accidentally, and the so called Quick Menu can be accessed and the phone muted, put into aircraft mode etc, without unlocking.

This is one amazing phone for making and receive call Before you buy it make sure you have a small electric screwdriver to put in the slot to help to take the back off which is like open a chocolate box lid Do not read the instructions they are totally miss leading Instead read Suli Niv review which is at the top of the review list follow his advice how to take the back off … and you will sure be a happy crappy This man is a star and probably saved thousands from going mad So much phone for ?12.95 and free delivery Plus 2 sim and 1 memory card slot Enjoy####[['Overall#Overall', '20,25', '12,19', '2'], ['Logistics#Shipping Fee', '512,520', '507,511', '2']]

Alright, I have to admit this purchase has been a downgrade instead of an upgrade. I went from galaxy s9 to s21... heart rate sensor is missing, the screen quality has been downgraded, no headphone jack, no memory card slot, no charging plug included in the box and the most annoying part is the fingerprint sensor is built in into the screen which means if you put a screen protector on its very unlikely to recognise your finger prints... so I'm always having to type my pin to go into my apps####[['Screen#General', '149,163', '173,183', '0'], ['Product Accessories#Charger', '228,241', '225,227', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '296,314', '270,283', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '296,314', '318,342', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '50,59', '-1,-1', '0']]

For the price you pay for it, you get a lot of quality apps that you wouldn't normally have access to. However, make sure that you buy wireless headphones to listen to music/videos because the headphone port is dreadful - there's no way of telling whether it's fully gone in and the slightest movement can knock it out of place and pause whatever you're listening to.####[['Product Accessories#Headphones', '193,207', '211,219', '0']]

I believe all phones turn off after a period of no use... It is called screen time out, if you go into the settings features on any phone it will have Screen off time or 1 minute to maybe 15 minutes or you can disable this feature so your screen is constantly on but this will reduce your battery time. Hope this helps... Open settings > Lock screen > Sleep ... (Change sleep time to 10 minutes) this will give you longer time before phone automatically sleeps which is a feature to save power ? Mine hasn't done that so maybe it's a fault####[]

I'm no expert but, according to Wikipedia, Giffgaff has been an official carrier of Apple devices in its stores since 2014, so should work on iPhones. Also, if the iPhone is fully paid for, no reason why the Giffgaff SIM card could not be used. The iPhone mini uses the mini SIM. As long as giffgaff have a mini SIM (they all do nowadays), there is no reason it wouldn't work. I'm assuming your iPhone was purchased SIM free with no contract? It’s an unlocked phone so should work with any provider. It should do as long as its unlocked, which all new phones should be. Yes it do yes perfectly Yes.

Yes, it should do. If you have a choice I would get the full sim card that you can "breakdown" into 3 different sized sims. I can't remember which size sim it takes, I think the middle size one ( no idea of the names of the different sizes). I can't check because my husband uses the phone and he is out for a walk in the somewhat cooler air! I hope that helps. Yes I see no reason why not. It is an unlocked phone so should take any sim. Hi,as long as the phone is unlocked,then it should take any service provider, but I have never tried it.####[]

Owned iPhones since the 3s and got to 6s and had it for 3years until the battery died. I thought of going up a couple of grades but settled on the yellow iPhone 11 64g. The photo I’ve included is night mode on the iPhone, just stunning! The Face ID is a terrific bit of security. The sound from the onboard speakers are great. There’s no headphone port. I’ve got wireless headphones and they work perfectly. It’s fast and easy to use. I’d always say buy a case. I bought a rubberised case and a glass screen guard just to protect it. A lightning cable will charge it. I bought a cheap wireless QI charger which protects the port.

I have found the camera to be really decent. As good as Motorola and superior to Cubot. Hi, In my opinion the cameras are very good indeed . I am very happy with the performance of the still and video images. I would say it is the best thing about the phone. High quality with the option of changing to 48mp, which is actually very high definition. Macro facility for close ups too. Selfie camera is good quality too. Is a really good camera to be just a phone camera.. I'm really happy of my pictures with this camera In my experience the main camera is first class. I have not used the others, so cannot comment on them. I'm not the keenest phone camera user as I prefer a stand-alone digital camera.

No you can play pubg at extreme 60 fps in smooth setting.. but if you want to get 90 fps and ultra graphics available then you have to download some "config file" for pubg. But trust me it is the real truth about 90 fps that this phone doesn't support 90 fps, if you get 90 fps by default in pubg, only that means your phone support it.. otherwise the poco x3 pro also doesn't support 90 fps.. if you want to enjoy pubg then play in smooth with extreme, it doesn't give you any kind of lag (also it depends on server network of pubg)####[]

I find this smartphone to be great value for money. I've put it through its paces and I can't fault it. The image quality from the camera pics are, frankly the best I've seen in any phones I've previously used. It also looks great not to mention it is clearly built for very heavy duty knocking about; the sturdiest phone I've seen. It's also as heavy as it looks. I wouldn't encourage keeping it in your summer shorts pocket. Everything you would expect in a more expensive phone comes as standard in this and for me, it all works a treat including NFC. Aesthetically, I think it looks great and I'm so happy I bought it. A full battery charge is lasting me about a day and a half.

The phone looks good, simple to use ... but on first boot up it got very quickly to the update page and then stayed on that for hours without apparent progress. I even left if for nearly a whole day. Eventually after several system restarts it got through the updates stage. At this point it seemed a reasonable phone, but then would not run an app I wanted, I decided to return it. If all you want is a cheap smart phone, then it probably fits the bill. Good points are the battery can be replaced (it's an old phone will you ever find one?) and easy to remove back to fit sim cards (you can have 2) and SD card. Screen is clear, Browser (Chrome) works pretty well, does seem a little slow, but not overly so. Not for me in the end, which is a shame as I had high hopes.####[['Overall#Overall', '312,317', '301,311', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '475,482', '483,498', '2'], ['Performance#Running Speed', '686,690', '677,685', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '648,653', '654,665', '2'], ['Screen#General', '614,620', '624,629', '2'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '547,566', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '16,20', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '22,35', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Price#Price', '404,409', '-1,-1', '2']]

Unfortunately this phone is nothing more than a dummy phone only works on Vodafone, ee or 02 so not much use when you're on any other network. This model is notorious for having sim card issues and not detecting a network. This should be stated in the description that only 3 networks can use the phone. Very disappointing and now a complete waste of money. This is why I have given it 1 star as I cannot use it. The battery does last ages but it doesn't do anything to use battery power quickly.

Bought for an elderly gent who used it and found all was easy to use and the loud speaker option was good. The docking/charging base is very easy for an elderly person as it avoids usb connection. Then all of a sudden it failed to switch on. The manual is awful and does not directly relate to this phone. Found a YT video from a user which explained how to save contacts etc. Would get again as nothing else for the price.

Nice and big and my son is pretty happy with it. His friends at school admire it! No problems with charging. My son says it's sometimes a bit 'laggy' if he's watching videos on it and he occasionally has to restart the phone. Fingerprint reader takes a couple of tries sometimes and the face recognition is not very reliable. But it does what it needs to do without any MAJOR issues and is a great phone for a ?100!####[['Ease of Use#Audience Groups', '20,23', '27,44', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '99,107', '82,98', '2'], ['Signal#Signal General', '143,148', '136,141', '0'], ['Performance#General', '200,224', '187,199', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '226,244', '245,278', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '287,303', '307,324', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '398,403', '333,382', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '398,403', '392,397', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '0,4', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '9,12', '-1,-1', '2']]

Hello. I'm not sure, but the charging cable has a completely different end compared to models 5 and 11. As far as I remember, the model 5 had a wide end for the charging cable and the model 11 has a narrow one, see on the internet. greetings As far as aware the 5 uses a different socket to the 11 lightening type , a cable is included so shouldn’t be a problem , may be worth your while to buy a standard usb to C type adapter as the supplied cable is C type to lightening , A charging cable comes with it Yes it’s a lightning cable on this one too Yes Yes it will do the job####[]

I bought this phone for my disabled wife who is in hospital. The phone generally is good, as the three configured phone numbers are all she needs. The setup is a bit fiddly and the graphics/menu look like something from a 70's pac man game. It could do with a more modern user interface . One drawback we find is the lack of a mute option. Doro support could only recommend reducing the volume to minimum, but this is too fiddly for my wife as it uses small buttons.####[['Overall#Overall', '65,70', '71,88', '2'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '151,156', '160,172', '0'], ['System#UI Interface Aesthetics', '190,194', '195,239', '0'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '327,338', '317,324', '0'], ['Key Design#General', '458,465', '452,457', '0'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '422,428', '418,421', '0']]

Hi, the volume control on the phone is the long bar on the left side, as you look at the screen. top of the bar increases the volume; bottom, decreases it, when depressed. I can control the phone volume by simply going to setting_sounds_phone_volume then slide + - If you have already gone into 'Settings' and you have no joy, go into the 'green telephone app', from there go into 'Settings' at the top right, then go to Sounds and Vibration, from there just increase each line setting. Hope this works for you. I must admit my volume is low. The only control is on the left hand side. Should have a button on side of phone####[['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '528,534', '538,541', '0']]

Yes but first you need to insert Indian SIM vard and need to make 1 call using it in India. Dear user, My answer is yes, because it has unique IMEI number, which is not match with other phones. In general government need this number for security purpose. In that case it is satisfying all safety protocols. Cost of the mobile is not more than 120 dollars, but performance is unmatchable with that price. So you can use it with confidently. Yes ofcourse!! Yes "Hi Thomas, Since the product is meant for sale in India only this product should be activated with a SIM card issued from a mobile operator within India.

This is a replacement phone for daughter. She dropped and smashed her screen! Would be more expensive to fix that replace. To be honest, the specifications of this phone is better than her old one anyway. She liked the purple back colour.

I bought two of these. One to leave in the car as a spare/emergency phone and the other for work. I deliver to peoples' houses and often don't get an answer from the front door. It's useful to give them a quick call to let them know I am there. Sometimes, I can hear the house phone ringing, but nothing in the phone ear piece, it's just dead. This seems to be a problem with the network rather than the phone as it runs on 2G. I have experienced this with several 2G phones of various makes so can't really blame this solely on the phone. The ringing tone, when it does work sounds very broken and noisy when it does work, it can also take quite a while to connect a call. Again, I think this is 2G technology rather than the phone itself. Just something to bear in mind.####[['Signal#Signal General', '380,387', '349,375', '0'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '544,556', '566,604', '0']]

Phone is sim free. If current SIM card fits phone, then contacts should transfer onto it. Yes, its exactly the same as setting up a new device! On iPhone its very simple and you can transfer all of the data off your old device onto this one very easily! Hope this helps! Mobile Reborn Ltd I only know Apple. If it is an apple all you would need to do is put your Apple log in details and everything from your old phone will transfer over. Usually as soon as you do that it’ll ask do you want everything to transfer. You can then pick what you want or just click yes to all. Hope that’s helped?

The reason for the two stars is that while I have the bulletproof/waterproof phone I need, it is painfully slow and often non responsive like an old PC that spends most of its time loading, thinking or buffering.

This would be a good starter phone but I now wish I'd bought a cheap smartphone whilst mine was in for repair. I only had this one for about a week and I still couldn't get the hang of it by the time my own phone was returned to me. I have passed it on to my brother who is unable to use a smartphone due to a skin condition. I could not have done anything other than make calls or send texts. There was no camera which, I didn't think I would miss but I did. But, I suppose it is what it is and it served a purpose, giving me peace of mind that I wasn't without a phone to keep in touch with my family whilst I was away.####[['Overall#Overall', '21,34', '16,20', '2'], ['Camera#General', '407,413', '404,406', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '290,300', '274,287', '0'], ['Price#Price', '63,68', '-1,-1', '2']]

It seems there's no such thing as quality replacement parts for Apple - certainly not the screen anyhow - so I'm delighted with this relatively cheap iPhone which came with 85% or so battery health and was thankfully "unimproved" by the refurbisher, it just clean and fully functional.
