I bought this phone for my 86 year old mother who was struggling to use her smart phone due to lack of pressure in her fingers. This has proved a great success. It’s lighter, you can answer by just opening the case and the buttons are big enough and don’t need a huge amount of pressure. A success all round. I would recommend to anyone who just needs a phone to make calls!####[['Ease of Use#Audience Groups', '27,45', '2,23', '2'], ['Key Design#General', '223,230', '235,245', '2'], ['Key Design#General', '223,230', '250,286', '2'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '317,326', '311,316', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Weight', '166,173', '-1,-1', '2']]

Appreciate your interest towards OnePlus. We would like to inform you that Zen Mode is OnePlus' version of the popular timeout class of apps. Like many other OEMs, OnePlus has made it an exclusive perk that only OnePlus owners can enjoy. With Zen Mode 2.0, however, it can't but help open it up to other Android phones because of one new feature Best mood for you####[]

I have not owned a smartphone - until this week. After extensive research over several days (I am retired!) I finally made a decision to purchase a Blackview 6300 smartphone from Amazon (amzservice).

Indeed it is a genuine Apple product and yes you will have technical support. It’s a good phone as well! It is a genuine Apple product and I needed to contact Apple technical support shortly after purchasing it and help was readily provided. I have recently heard that Amazon and Apple have established a marketing relationship, so it seems likely that Apple is happy for Amazon to sell their goods, even at a reduced price. I hope this helps. Russell Yes as far as I’m aware this is a genuine Aple product. It updated in the usual way. Yes, absolutely genuine. When you set up the phone, it gives you an option to add Apple care It looked genuine in the right packaging and every thing moved from my old iPhone OK. If you really want reassurance ask Amazon.

It took 3 phones from Amazon to get one that did not switch itself on every time I plugged in the charger and would then buzz/vibrate for 10 seconds which it was doing every time it was switched on, annoying to say the least. I did persevere with it as apart from that it is a nice phone especially as I purchased it during the Amazon Prime Sale. I would have given it more stars had it not had this problem, I did speak to Xiaomi UK service and they were not aware of the issue (???) and their only suggestion was to return it for repair which I declined as the phone was new.####[['Overall#Overall', '282,287', '277,281', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '563,568', '573,576', '2']]

Hello, Thank you for your message. We are selling our phones with battery health at least 85 percent and above. Kind regards, Beata from Gadget Store It was , it wasn’t 100% but came up as 90% and hold the battery life really well for a reconditioned one. The battery is good, after a full day, with average use, battery has approx 80-85% left They vary but are supposed to be better than 80%. Mine was on 95% and in excellent condition. The phone I received had a battery capacity of 85% which initially disappointed me. However it holds its charge very well and so far has retained its capacity.Hope this proves helpful. 80% battery health 90% I believe normally above 85% Hi I don’t know the percentage but from a full charge it lasts me 4days Hope this helps 100% had no bother with it####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '66,80', '81,110', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '206,218', '219,230', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '260,267', '271,275', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '313,320', '325,343', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '732,737', '741,746', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '465,488', '495,517', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '406,436', '-1,-1', '2']]

Upgraded from the 7 plus. I was really excited to get the new iPhone as I’ve wanted to upgrade for a while but put off by the price tag. First impression was “oh, that’s it” I expected it to be bigger. It was smaller than my 7 plus, looked more square like an old IPhone 4 but heavier. Straight away, the first thing I noticed was how yellow the screen was so I turned off the auto brightness and messed with a few other setting but was still annoyed by how yellow and dull it looked. I tried taking the same photos with the 12 pro and my 7 plus and actually preferred the colour and quality of my old phone’s photos. I even emailed myself the photos to have on the device to ensure it wasn’t just the yellowness of the screen that made them look bad and it wasn’t. Not impressed at all and not worth the money so I have returned my first ever iPhone.####[['Appearance Design#Color', '573,579', '550,568', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '584,616', '550,568', '2'], ['Screen#General', '346,352', '335,341', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '194,200', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '209,216', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Weight', '277,284', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '766,810', '-1,-1', '0']]

An interesting fact about @amazon If you purchase a #MobilePhone from #Amazon, they do not provide an #IMEI number on the invoice, are unwilling to do so & you are unable to get #insurance This information is required on purchase paperwork to obtain insurance. An IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity. Think of it as your phone's fingerprint — it's a 15-digit number unique to each device. Phone carriers and manufacturers share IMEI numbers to enable tracking of smartphones that may be stolen or compromised.####[['After-sales Service#Exchange/Warranty/Return', '180,188', '164,177', '0']]

Was a great phone now slowing down and imperfections are evident. Bluetooth is glitchy, often disconnects and reconnects, but it refuses to connect with my car. Certain apps won't load until you force close them and restart them. 4G issues, having to reboot the phone for certain things to work, It's only with having this phone for a few months have things come out the woodwork. On the positive sides, Screen is great if a little washed out in bright sunlight. Speakers are great, dual stereo, offer impressively loud and clear experience!

I bought this phone for my wife after buying the Redmi Note 10 Pro for myself when there was an Amazon deal on. I though the 10 5G would be similar. Similar, but colours on the screen and the camera quality are no where near as good. If you aren't bothered about the camera, or accuracy of the colours this is great phone. Great features, great battery, etc. If you intend to make use of the camera I'd suggest going for the Redmi Note 10 Pro.####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '345,352', '339,344', '2'], ['Camera#General', '192,206', '211,232', '0'], ['Screen#General', '162,183', '211,232', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '316,321', '310,315', '2'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '399,442', '-1,-1', '2']]

Out of the box it is more chunky than your top of the line phones but by the time they have covers on there is not much in it. The phone is heavier than expected, teen owner sees it as more manly and he definitely did not want an iPhone as his sister has managed to destroy several. The rugged look and feel means it looks like it will last and less attractive than an iPhone for thrives.

This is a very good, simple small mobile for an elderly person who doesn’t need anything complicated. Three personally labelled speed dials make it very easy for people to dial most needed and used numbers. Great little docking station to recharge with an emergency dial button on the back that can be programmed. Only issue we have experienced is the accidental pressing of the emergency button on the rear of the phone when docking the phone hence the 4 stars. However once mastered there have been no more accidental calls####[['Overall#Overall', '34,40', '10,33', '2']]

Was very happy until (after 6 months) phone produced an error message ("dm-verity corruption") that the supplier (UF Mobile) said meant that it needed to be repaired. Supplier wanted me to pay to send the phone from UK to China, and to lie on the Customs Declaration, to state that it was a gift and with a value significantly less than it was worth. I refused, and complained to Amazon, who organised a complete refund - so 5 stars for Amazon's service, and somewhat fewer for UF Mobile. Phone itself was fine while it lasted, but the boot-up error message came out of the blue and gave me no confidence it wouldn't happen again after repair or replacement.####[['Overall#Overall', '489,494', '506,526', '2'], ['Performance#General', '536,557', '558,578', '0']]

Battery draining quick. I have charged the phone 5 times in 2 days. My wife bought Mi phone a day before I purchased this one and she has only charged hers once in 4 days. I am not happy.

I will return this for a Redmi note pro 10 that my wife has got. The only thing about this phone is it chargers quicker but I don't want to be carrying my charger up and down.

This monster eats battery. I charged it fully from turning it on you could see the % fall as minutes ticked by. I put in the cable to charge while i was using it and while it slowed down the drain but it was still falling by 1% every 5 mins which is no good to anybody. I dread to think the drop If it didn't have a charging cable in the same time. Also the sound stops periodically for no reason but then returns at random which was odd. I thought id test it in my car and it appears the blue tooth doesn't work. Also one other thing is apps crash all the time. include the one that lets you kill apps and slide between apps when you have multiple open. I think Ill be sending this thing back today.####[['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '358,363', '364,396', '0'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '489,499', '500,512', '0'], ['System#Application', '538,542', '543,561', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '29,64', '83,110', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '214,240', '208,213', '0']]

Yes . I swapped from a G4 .You can have two sims or one sim and one memory card.My card from G4 ne3eded reformatting for the G30 so I lost anything on . Dont know if that is a general problem. The G30 has a micro-sim fitting. Not sure which G4 has. Yes , as long as it's the very small micro SD card , which is now the most common on used in smart phones Just checked this for you both the G4 and the G30 take nano SIM cards so you should be fine.

The included charge is only 15W. So the included charger does not give you the fastest charging the phone is capable of. SIM pin and adapter/charger both provided. You could also apply for a free pair of galaxy ear buds although you will need to check whether that offer is still open. This was an unlocked phone. No idea about a sim pin and I do not understand about a power adapter. the phone came with a charger. Yes it comes with all of the above in the box but no headphones.

The SIM was a bit fiddly to fit and I inserted it without the carrier in the end. It is easy to use, though I have still not worked out some of the features like speaker when on calls.

This was a customer return I purchased. The 5g works great with this device. It really is like using my superfast bt broadband. No hitches waiting no nothing just loads really really quickly. Nothing wrong with the phone at all. It's brilliant. Lovely clear screen. Calls clear and loud or quiet. Fast charging. Page refresh is top speed. Works great with no issues on call of duty which takes lots of power to run, and this phone handles it all no problem Lovely back on phone it's like mirrored but feels so solid. Battery runs down bit to quick and that's just browsing the internet. Well worth the money####[['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '517,534', '535,547', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '339,344', '345,350', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '302,310', '297,301', '2'], ['Signal#Call Quality', '266,271', '272,295', '2'], ['Screen#General', '258,264', '245,257', '2'], ['Performance#Running Speed', '163,168', '169,190', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '234,243', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Price#Value for Money', '587,607', '-1,-1', '2']]

This phone is absolutely shocking, it's so slow!! Like a snails pace. Bought this for my daughters birthday which she only opened 2 days ago but because I ordered last month we have gone over the 30 day returns policy. The storage is ridiculously small, put 5 different storage cards in the phone and apparently all 5 were corrupt when they all work perfectly in my Samsung S9. The camera is blurry, the touch sensitivity is touch and go. The facial recognition doesn't work. Takes like 5 years to fully charge even with a fast charger. Would definitely avoid. I wouldn't even give this to my 5 year old as a play phone####[['Performance#Running Speed', '43,47', '40,42', '0'], ['Product Configuration#Memory', '223,230', '234,252', '0'], ['Camera#General', '382,388', '392,398', '0'], ['Screen#General', '404,421', '425,437', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '443,461', '462,474', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '498,510', '476,497', '0'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '554,559', '537,553', '0']]

Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a ... load of money with them. But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger. So please spend how much extra?

This will depend on your phone contract not the phone . Best speak to your service provider . It would probably depend on the SIM card that you have ask your network provider I’m guessing as it’s a mobile phone it can be used in any country. If you message the seller I’m sure they can give you the answer I would think it’s more to do with your sim rather than your phone Hope this helps####[]

It’s a good easy to use phone with long battery life and works well when you have a good signal from the network you have joined.There seems to be a problem with the signal display It shows full signal strength and you find you can’t take or make a call using the network you have joined if you are in a weak signal area. It appears that the phone displays the signal strength from stronger rival networks .If the phone displayed the signal strength from your network you could find the best location for your phone thus avoiding callers getting “phone unavailable message “####[['Overall#Overall', '24,29', '7,11', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '40,52', '35,39', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '24,29', '57,67', '2'], ['Signal#Signal General', '166,180', '135,161', '0'], ['Signal#Call Quality', '228,271', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '12,23', '-1,-1', '2']]

I love technology and new gadget but I think the companies manipulate us into thinking we need the newest products every year, so you spend more money. This phone is great. Budget price, just updated to the latest Android OS. The camera takes photos worthy of a much higher spec phone. The screen is clear and bright and comes with an under screen fingerprint sensor. Only down side is there's only one built in speaker so the sound isn't great. Also it's positioning means you can sometimes cover it when holding the phone trying to listen. That being said, must of the time I use headphones or a BT speaker so it isn't a problem. As I said very decent phone for the price, large screen. I've bought them for my partner and mum when they needed upgrades.####[['Overall#Overall', '157,162', '166,171', '2'], ['Price#Price', '180,185', '173,179', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '230,249', '250,284', '2'], ['Screen#Clarity', '290,296', '300,316', '2'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '335,366', '321,331', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '412,419', '386,411', '0'], ['Audio/Sound#Tone quality', '427,432', '433,444', '0'], ['Price#Value for Money', '654,673', '642,653', '2'], ['Screen#Size', '681,687', '675,680', '2']]

I just didn't get on with android, there does seem to be so much bloat wear preinstalled, definitely not stock android. The fingerprint sensor could have been faulty on this model but a 50% hit rate wasn't good. It's a quite heavy phone compared to the iPhone 12, and navigating around the huge screen could be difficult. However, you cant distract from the wonderful screen and the camera which is brilliant. If it came with stock android it would be so much better. Simply too many settings- for me off-putting- but for others, I suppose that's the beauty of this phone. It was just not for me, so a return to the relative simplicity of an iPhone. I really wanted to like this, and I do appreciate the beauty of the phone. If you are an android user then its a no brainer, the best android phone out there at the moment.####[['System#Application', '65,88', '57,64', '0'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '124,142', '159,165', '0'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '124,142', '186,210', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Weight', '225,230', '219,224', '0'], ['Screen#Size', '295,301', '290,294', '0'], ['Screen#General', '368,374', '358,367', '2'], ['Camera#General', '383,389', '399,408', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '784,797', '779,783', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Aesthetics General', '704,710', '686,699', '2']]

Very glad I bought the mini as I’ve since tried a friends full size 12 and it’s way to big for my hands (which are large for a woman). This is my 4th apple phone, it’s everything I would expect I just hope it doesn’t get made obsolete as quickly as my last (the mic and camera just stopped working after the latest iOS update). My only wings is the that the Facial recognition feature being released a year after coronavirus lockdown 1, not recognising your face in a mask OR giving you fingerprint alternative is far from ideal. You have to key in your passcode. I feel fingerprint tech should have been kept given the shortfall in facial recognition####[['Buyer Attitude#Shopping Experiences', '12,18', '0,9', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '58,67', '80,103', '2'], ['Camera#General', '270,276', '277,297', '0'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '262,265', '277,297', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '437,510', '514,528', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '633,651', '620,629', '0']]

Phine was an utter disappointment , had high expectations given the seven spec for a budget smartphone. I currently have a mito G7 power , which is nearly 2 years old, and in almksy every area which mattered the old G7 was superior. The quality of the screen was poor and had lag just simply navigating through phone, with barely any apps uploaded. Also the G7 was faster when browsing. Returned and sticking with Motorola####[['Overall#Overall', '0,5', '13,33', '0'], ['Screen#General', '237,258', '263,267', '0'], ['Signal#Signal General', '276,279', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Performance#Running Speed', '365,371', '-1,-1', '2']]

Should work, phone is open to all networks. I am using a lebara sim in mine. I'm with ee and it works great. I understand it is unlocked so should work for any network.

Bought this phone as a gift. So far so good.  The only turn-off was their customer service in replying, had to repeat my question in the chat and one one my question was ignored.  Other than that it was good.####[]

I must say people who are not liking this phone are the onw who got the first copy by mistake ;) Jokes apart but this budget flagship killer is really a true beast. I have used brands like Samsung, apple, oneplus, moto but not a single phone will provide you the best features like pro max, that to at such a price point. If you are planning to buy it, go for it, without any doubt. Vintage bronze is killer colour. Camera quality during day light is un beatable. Only issue is the phone is huge. The Cinematic experience is laajwaab. You can experience the surround and crisp sound. Display with 60 / 120 hertz is great. Camera ring is too attractive and camera quality is great. The people who are complaining are either paid or oppo / vivo / iqq lovers....####[['Appearance Design#Color', '383,397', '401,414', '2'], ['Camera#General', '416,430', '451,462', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Tone quality', '577,582', '558,576', '2'], ['Camera#General', '622,633', '637,651', '2'], ['Screen#Clarity', '584,611', '615,620', '2'], ['Camera#General', '656,670', '674,679', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '491,495', '-1,-1', '0']]
Writing this review after 15 days of usage. I can say that one plus has finally upgraded many things, eg bandwidth for 5g , camera etc. Charging is fantastic. Value for money. Would have give 5 stars but it needs some bug fixtures which i am sure it will be done after the updates. One more thing is if you are using the phone cover provided by the company, the weight is slightly increased. Nothing apart from that. This product is value for money.####[['Signal#Signal of Mobile Network', '105,121', '72,88', '2'], ['Camera#General', '124,130', '72,88', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '136,144', '148,157', '2'], ['Product Accessories#Phone Cases', '321,332', '362,390', '0'], ['Price#Value for Money', '159,174', '-1,-1', '2'], ['System#Operation Smoothness', '218,221', '-1,-1', '0']]

This is the second outdoor phone my husband has bought, and he really loves this kind of heavy but long standby phone. This outdoor mobile phone is what he bought after comparing many products. The price is cheap but the quality is super good. It will not be damaged when falling from a high place, and it is waterproof and oil-proof. Supports two SIM cards and 512 memory cards, the mobile phone runs fast, the picture is clear, the call quality is good. It has a long battery life and can be charged once in two days, which is a major feature of outdoor mobile phone.

I bought the phone because I was after a decent camera and it didn't disappoint. Fingerprint reader is not always reacting and my old phone battery lasted longer (I believe that the display itself it draining the battery as is massive). But is not an issue with the fast charger. It took me a while to get used to the size and weight of the phone but I like the phone.####[['Camera#General', '48,54', '41,47', '2'], ['Camera#General', '48,54', '62,79', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '362,367', '353,357', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '140,147', '148,161', '2'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '81,99', '103,122', '1'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '200,220', '227,234', '0']]
This could and should be a good phone. Unfortunately there are too many niggling issues. Main one is the location of the finger print sensor - on the side, just where you hold the phone, so it's always trying to activate. Also, the sensor is too sensitive - the lightest of touches is all it needs. And then there's the ridiculous 'Find on page' tool in Android that is activated by the finger print sensor, so it's forever interrupting web use. Other major issue with this phone is screen rotation - quick to happen but ages to reorientate. Overall, a mistake to have chosen this.####[['System#Lock Screen Design', '105,140', '195,220', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '232,238', '242,255', '0'], ['Screen#General', '483,498', '501,540', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '387,406', '416,444', '0']]

Great phone so far. Good battery life( 69% and used it last 11 hrs without charging) does not have face recognition far as I can tell as went back to the home button like earlier iPhones.

I have found the face recognition on this phone extremely reliable. But if that fails the fingerprint recognition is built in to the power button on the side and is fantastic, works every time. So many adjustments possible that I do feel this phone would be good for a visually impaired person to use. Many commands can work from the "Hey Google" facility that is built in. Yes it has finger print scanner on side of phone and facial recognition too Yes you can use without fingerprint and face recognition, also you can use the accessibility settings to make it usable for the visually impaired I hope this help all the best You can use without fingerprint or face recognition, you do not need to lock it at all if you choose not to.

It is an Iphone, does what an Iphone should, but the battery life is TERRIBLE. I bought this for my wife, who never uses it from one day to the next, maybe 3/4 calls a month.

I sent it to Apple for diagnostics, and they said it was fine.

The seller was good with quick and prompt delivery. The phone itself is hit and miss. Totally Samsung's fault. I bought this as a replacements phone to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro which was very fast and reliable compared to this. Way too much bloatware on Samsung's part which can slow the phone down and even run tasks in the background which slow down your Internet! Daily tasks can sometimes be very slow. I also attribute this to the Exynos chipset which is already several years old. Build quality is okay, not the best but passable. Based on my experience with this current Samsung's performance, I would actually steer clear of Samsung phones in the future and go towards a more reliable alternative Seller was great though and a very reasonable price####[['Seller Service#Attitude', '4,10', '15,19', '2'], ['Logistics#Speed', '42,50', '25,41', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '56,61', '72,84', '0'], ['Performance#Running Speed', '189,193', '184,188', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '198,206', '184,188', '2'], ['System#Application', '238,247', '225,237', '0'], ['Signal#Signal of Mobile Network', '354,362', '339,348', '0'], ['Performance#Running Speed', '364,375', '393,402', '0'], ['Product Quality#General', '484,497', '501,505', '2'], ['Buyer Attitude#Repurchase and Churn Tendency', '630,644', '600,629', '0'], ['Seller Service#Attitude', '702,708', '713,718', '2'], ['Price#Price', '748,753', '732,747', '2']]

My husband bought this based on good reviews. Battery was under 80% which Apple recommend is below working order. Asked the seller to replace but told us to send it back for a refund as wasn't prepared to swap. We even offered to buy a new phone in the interim and transfer the data, then send it back, as long as they confirm the battery life on the next phone was better. Was met with poor customer service and a cant be bothered attitude. We'll have to spend ?80 on a new battery from Apple.

Unfortunately Samsung have yet again removed items that differentiate them from apple/google. No more expandable memory slot no more charger after they had a go at apple for removing theirs. the thing about being more eco friendly is a joke as it means more packaging and delivery emissions to get what you used to in the box as standard.

This is my 4th OnePlus phone, my last being the 7Pro. I wanted an new phone but couldn't justify spending over ?800 for a top end model. The OnePlus Nord is slender, light and feels great in the hand. It's fast, responsive, takes great photos and the display is bright and crisp. I think OnePlus have made an error though.... With such a great spec on this device I really can't see why anyone would choose to spend over ?800 for the latest OnePlus 9/Pro models! The battery life is better than my OnePlus 7pro, the display seems a lot better and the fast charging is incredible! I'm really happy with purchase.

I can confirm it does have the WIFI Calling feature. I've used it a few times so far without any issues. Yes this phone has Wi-Fi Calling installed.

Bought this as a replacement for an old galaxy A3 which was made from metal and glass so this felt cheap and plasticky in comparison. I also didn't like the size of it especially the length. If you want to walk around with a brick in your pocket then fare enough but I don't understand why phones have to be so big. May as well carry your tablet with you. Are we going back to the 1980's early car phones. I didn't have it long enough to comment on its other features except I found the fingerprint sensor on the rear very hard and clumsy to use. I changed it for a S10e which although more expensive even second hand is a far better feel in the hand.####[['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '157,161', '141,152', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '183,189', '141,152', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '311,314', '308,310', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '487,517', '518,545', '0'], ['Price#Price', '591,600', '586,590', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Grip Feeling', '634,650', '621,633', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Workmanship and Texture', '94,118', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '606,617', '-1,-1', '0']]

I have used the a20e happily and trouble-free for 2 years and wanted a second one for a family member. It is compact & durable. Rapid charging and good battery life eliminates any concerns about running out of charge. I use mine for email, phone/text, word processing , video watching, camera. Once a micro sd card is installed and used for storage of photos and large files, there is very ample storage.

I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now.

needed an emergency phone after dropping mine in the bath and this was the only one with same day delivery. Was delivered very promptly and set up was easy enough. ( instructions in plain English). Looking at the comments I had my expectations well managed BUT this is so much worse then anticipated: the screen colours are tinted green which makes all video callers look sick and the sound is so bad it actually hurts listening to a conversation for too long! The quality of the video calls on Whatsapp are hit and miss. The speed is as can be expected but I don't use my phone for anything but calls and satnav so am not too fussy.

Cheap copy of an old Nokia mobile. Which works, comes with charger & wired ear phones, sim card adapters. Calls are clear & good sound quality & volume, but the ringtone sound a bit tinny needs a better speaker. No phone storage at all, you need to insert a memory card to save ringtones or pics or videos to, has Bluetooth to make transferring ring tones from old phone easy. The few standard ring / message tones are very 80's & dreadful at best. Put new sim card in & worked straight away after activated. Has a radio but only works with the wired ear phones as they act as ariel. The torch / light is bright. Not bad for ?15 delivered.####[['Overall#Overall', '17,33', '0,13', '0'], ['Product Accessories#Charger', '59,66', '48,58', '2'], ['Product Accessories#Headphones', '69,85', '48,58', '2'], ['Signal#Call Quality', '106,111', '116,121', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Tone quality', '129,142', '124,128', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '145,151', '124,128', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '161,175', '176,187', '0'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '203,210', '188,202', '0'], ['Product Configuration#Memory', '215,228', '212,214', '0'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '314,323', '310,313', '2'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '314,323', '327,375', '2']]

Do not buy any mobile phones from this company, they are using cheap replacement parts to repair there refurbished mobiles , they over heat after 5 minutes of browsing the web.

I brought this as a replacement for my realme 6. The issues started with the phone when I tried the realme phone clone and that deleted everything off both phones.

I've had the previous model and wasn't that impressed but this model has changed my mind OnePlus. First of all this phone is a lot smoother with the new OxygenOS and it also feels better built than the previous model. The camera is great of everyday photos at this price point but it isn't something I use a great deal. I mainly use this phone for emails, calls, and everyday tasks. The duel sim option is fantastic and I don't understand why more companies don't include this function. Overall this phone feels like it has much more premium price point and I would happily recommend to everyone####[['Performance#Running Speed', '131,139', '125,130', '2'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '558,595', '-1,-1', '2']]

Yes will stay on 24/7 as long as you keep it charged. I leave my phone on 24/7 for emergency calls, but turn WiFi and 4G off. I've never had a problem. Yes it will if you set it within the settings to do so ( and it has enough battery). Unless you (a) forget to recharge, (b) switch it off. The answer is yes it will remain active. Thats up to you. It works like any other mobile phone. As long as the battery has a charge then the phone will remain on. If you do require the phone to be available throughout the day, then there are battery saving settings built into the phone that you can make use of, and if you would like some assistance making the most of these, then our Customer Support team would be more than happy to advise. We hope this helps! ^DB at Samsung Support####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '227,234', '220,226', '2']]

No surprises here. If you're a Moto G fan you'll not find anything to surprise you with this phone. It's a good step up design-wise from my G8 Plus which felt slightly old fashioned even when I got it the week it was released. G50 isn't mega fast or mega high-def or indeed mega anything.

The phones no longer come with a power plug / adapter, so either plug the lightening cable into an adapter from another phone or tablet or plug it into a USB port on a PC, Mac or laptop. Some wall and trailing sockets have USB power outlets built in and you can use that to charge your iPhone too. Failing all of that, buy a plug in charger with USB. You use the lightening cable in the usual way to charge your phone. You plug it into the base of the phone to charge it and/or transfer data. One end goes in the connection at the bottom of the phone the other goes into a usb socket I use it only for charging####[['Product Accessories#Charger', '33,53', '11,30', '0']]

Hello. As far as I can tell, a SIM card doesn’t have system specific data on it, so it should work on any type of phone. If for some reason it doesn’t, your service provider should be able to send you a new card. They generally don’t charge for a replacement as it’s in their interest to keep you as a customer. Assuming that your mini SIM is not bespoke to I phones, I would say yes because I have a Plusnet mini SIM in mine.

Got this car holder for my car, I've used the arm and not the vent-plug because I wanted it to be more at the same level as the dials, so easy to keep an eye on the GPS. The suction is great, quite powerful (be careful when you put it on, it's hard to take it off again hehe), the arm, once fixed, is sturdy and a great holder, I'm using it with the big iPhone 12 pro max and it fits perfectly.

Bought this phone for my partner as he needs a larger screen due to being partially sighted and hates contract phones so I purchased this phone. Fairly easy to set up and happy with purchase until we tried to download a really important app that he needs for his diabetes and the phone is not NFC compatible so there are apps that we can't download which I would not have known about as I always have a Samsung and have never had a problem.

Probably the best way to use your smart TV with your phone is to use a 'chromecast' device. I tried a direct screen cast from phone to TV but could not get it to work. Maybe other users have had more success and can give better advice. Yes it connects to my Samsung TV through Google nest mini, but you can also cast from your phone. This phone does have the ability to "cast" your screen and certain apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Video to any devices that allow for this function. If your TV is not compatible you can purchase a ChromeCast for an additional ?40 which can turn your Samsung TV into a Smart TV to allow this function you require.####[]

Using the phone is easy enough, but ever since buying it's been difficult to charge. The charger doesn't seem to stay in the phone (we have tried multiple different charging cables, it's always the same) and now the battery is barely holding the charge at all. It's a real problem as it's a phone we bought for my mum in a care home and she is not able to plug it in herself. We charge it every time we visit - every day - and she does not actually even use the phone that much, but even with her light usage, the phone does not have enough charge to last until the next day. It's very disappointing and I wouldn't be recommending anyone to buy this phone. Sure, it's cheap, but we bought it because we thought it would be good in our situation, and it hasn't been.####[['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '0,15', '19,30', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '77,83', '64,76', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '216,223', '227,259', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '89,96', '97,130', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '541,574', '520,540', '0'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '615,630', '606,614', '0'], ['Price#Price', '668,673', '-1,-1', '2']]

When I first bought the phone it was operating well. After 3 months, it started crashing and generally was very slow.Then battery issues started appearing. I fully charged the batter and the other day when woke up it was 30% - 50% down without having used it at all, during the night. Now the phone is overheated very ofter even when I do not run many apps. It is worryingly heated up, so I have to switch it off in order to cool it.Yesterday, during the night the battery went from 90% to 1% without having it used at all and the phone was off in the morning. I am very disappointed from this phone and I consider it very dangerous to carry it with me when overheated.

I have had this phone now for a week and the snapdragon 865 makes a difference. I had the previous S20 which I returned due to overheating and poor battery life. I usually get 6 to 7 hours screen on time and I am also listening to music when not looking at the screen. ( So normally I would only have 2 to 3 hours screen on time per day so I am hoping I might get 2 days out of this phone.) Camera is good but I do wish Samsung would tone the colours down a bit.

Jailbroken means that your device contains a non-original operating system from Apple, therefore this is why some apps are not working. Apple does not support jailbroken devices, it removes the warranty immediately. I didn't touch the phone, I didn't even remove the stickers.

I tried the phone holder in various places and as you can see from the pic its just perfect stuck to the windscreen. It gives plenty of suction power when attached to glass, its good but nor perfect elsewhere.

Mine arrived today. At best it’s a grade c. The screen is covered in scratches. I’ve messaged them for some advice/small part refund. I expected the odd scratch but it’s awful. I just received mine, which is a birthday gift for my son. I would say mine is Grade A, no marks, 100% battery. Mine is Grade A, perfect not a mark anywhere, works perfect and battery is at 100%. From my experience, my item was in near immaculate condition. I would grade mine as A (mint). Mine would be a Grade B as there were clear 'dinks' in three of the four corners, where it had been dropped, i'd say onto concrete or other hard surface, but the front screen and back were perfect. So clearly not as new.

No, the Nokia 105 (2019 edition) does not have hotspot. If you mean WiFi hotspot, the answer is no. It does not have WiFi capability. It is just a very basic voice and text phone. No internet, no WiFi, no camera and, thankfully, no Android to become out of date (no FaceBook or other social media and no apps to crash or interfere with basic phone functions). That's why I love this simple, basic phone. I do not think so because it does not have internet access. The phone simply rings/answers a call and sends/receives SMS messages. No, this is a cheap, very basic phone. My experience with it was very negative and I have stopped using it.

I've been facing an autohanging and autoreboot issue from last August 11 morning which leads me to lose faith in devices from such a big and old brand. So, I won't recommend it to anybody who really wants to get a positive ROI. In spite of following best practices recommended generally, I encountered such issues within a very short time frame ( around 10 months). The only option which is left for me now to do a hard reset before going authorised service center. I already intimated Samsung support team via support portal and the concerned team already raised their hands by suggesting me to visit service center. Please don't invest in this device.####[['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '156,226', '-1,-1', '0']]

I bought this phone to replace a previous armoured android phone. My job means i have to use the phone in very harsh environments. It gets dropped…or dusty….or soaking wet. It has to work at hot or cold temperatures . The phone is excellent for the price…the screen is bright and clear and the phone is easy to use. The battery life is amazing. The only downsides are….the bluetooth is very unstable and drops out regularly which is awkward when connecting to a car…calls will cut off half way through. The fingerprint recognition is not brilliant so the password has to be used instead…not an earth shattering issue. For the price and for its plus points the phone is really good and I would recommend it .####[['Screen#General', '259,265', '269,285', '2'], ['Price#Value for Money', '249,254', '231,244', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '320,332', '336,343', '2'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '373,382', '386,423', '0'], ['Signal#Call Quality', '466,471', '472,501', '0'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '507,530', '534,547', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '676,680', '669,675', '2'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '685,705', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Ease of Use#Easy to Use', '303,314', '-1,-1', '2']]

This VANMASS Car Phone Holder has been great. The suction to the windscreen is excellent, and the thick telescopic arm almost holds the phone vibration free at the longest extension. In my car I don’t need the telescopic arm at full extension, so there is practically no vibration while holding my large smart phone unless tackling those pot holes. In the box apart from the windscreen suction holder is a vent phone holder which is also good quality, I don’t tend to use the vent option as I like to use the vents in the front and adjust them when needed. Overall, this VANMASS Car Phone Holder is excellent in quality and holds my phone perfectly. And although slightly more expensive, in this case you get what you pay for. I hope you find my review helpful Alan####[['Overall#Overall', '5,29', '39,44', '2'], ['Product Quality#General', '443,450', '438,442', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Thickness', '98,103', '-1,-1', '2']]

Phone stopped charging after 3 months, replaced charger, didn't work. Got new charging port. 1 month later same thing happened.

I have this phone for months now, and it's just brilliant! Incredible super macro photos! The battery life is also amazing! I also have Galaxy S21 Ultra, and I can say Samsung could learn some things from Redmi. I have a good connection with the redmi, where the S21 Ultra has none (Both phones are on the same mobile operator). Also, the super macro is something that the Galaxy is missing. With the Redmi 10 Pro camera, you can focus on even the tiniest object. 5 stars are well deserved!####[['Overall#Overall', '48,57', '43,47', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '70,88', '59,69', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '94,106', '115,122', '2'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '226,251', '214,225', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '339,350', '373,390', '0'], ['Camera#General', '401,420', '426,462', '2']]

The main reason for buying the iPhone 12 mini was the size. It's perfect. It's rare that I watch anything much on my phone and certainly not a movie or documentary, so it's great to have a robust, lightweight device that I can fit in my pocket without too much aggravation.

Screen is amazing, as is the responsiveness of the phone itself. It really feels more like a tablet hybrid, given its size.

Hi,this phone have aprox 200 g.This one is best to use as work phone but i can’t recommend it Not a very light one, but I like to feel the phone in my hand. It's kind of holding two Samsung or iphones. around 300g its pretty heavy but I have gotten used to it now and it doesn't bother me, only issue is if you drop it on your face when watching videos in bed Not happy with the supplier.

Little stunner. If you don’t want to be addicted to a screen, buy this. Ok, have a smart phone that you only turn on for banking and email or something but believe me, you find you have more time for you. Like I said, pretty great phone. Well worth the money. And if you buy Asda SIM cards you dont have to register it etc. You just buy good old top up numbers and type them in. Take your life back and have two phones. Emails can wait, banking can do whenever.

If you buy a phone you usually get an option to have a free subscription trial and then, when this concludes, you will be charged a monthly fee. Alternatively you’ve bought music on iTunes and this is what you are playing? Because you can buy and download individual songs to your library.

The phone was good but the battery over heated the phone in less than 5 months.

I have had Android phones from numerous brands, but this is unfortunately by far the worst experience I have ever had. The fingerprint reader is hardly responsive despite having done three prints of the same finger. The NFC is oftentimes not working properly. The phone is quite heavy. The picture quality is not what I would have expected. Overall it is simply not value for money. I had it for over two weeks, so enough time to get used to, but it just doesn't do its job. Very disappointing, and quite shocking to be honest, that a device that badly designed can be thrown onto the market. I returned it and now have a different device, not sure if I can name the product but it is so much better. Feel free to contact me about make and model, it's a similar price.####[['Overall#Overall', '19,25', '85,90', '0'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '123,141', '145,162', '0'], ['System#NFC', '220,223', '227,258', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Weight', '279,284', '273,278', '0'], ['Screen#Clarity', '290,305', '309,339', '0'], ['Price#Value for Money', '366,381', '355,365', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '480,493', '475,479', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '535,541', '547,561', '0']]

Finding a small smartphone is getting harder and I initially feared this replacement for my much-loathed Sony Xz1 compact would be too large. But it's not. More generally, it's an excellent phone. Fast, plenty of on-board storage, well-designed, feels good in the hand, and has a camera that produces impressive photos. My only real complaint is that I'd like it to have the mre recent and tougher gorilla glass (for which I've deducted a star), but that's a relatively minor quibble.

As a 'phone it works but for anything else it is useless. I bought it to replace a 12 year old Nokia, which is coming to the end of its life however it doesn't do half the things the old 'phone did & I'm now back to limping that along. I didn't want a smart 'phone but something small enough to carry in a pocket while dog walking or horse riding. This is a real disappointment. Sending a text is a nightmare as it has no predictive text & doesn't even automatically insert capital letters so takes about 3 times as long as with my old faithful. It also lacks many useful tools such as a timer. I'm afraid it's relegated to a draw for the foreseeable future.####[['Overall#Overall', '6,11', '15,20', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '6,11', '49,56', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '160,197', '152,159', '0']]

Excellent camera was the main selling point for me.

Hello,the c21 smartphone support dual Nano SIM card, you can insert two Sim cards or insert one SIM card with one TF card. thanks.

Dear Customer, Thank you for your interest in our mobile phone. The battery of our mobile phone is really big, usually it can be used for 2-3 days after it is fully charged, so there is no need to replace the battery. If you have other questions or if you have problems while using your mobile phone, you can contact us directly and we will solve them as soon as possible. Official email: laoying90@yeah.net Regards MALL-PHONE It's a very waterproof phone so the battery is completely sealed inside. However, as the battery lasts 3-5 days (depending on how heavily you use it), instead of the usual 5-8 hours of normal smartphones, you'll be charging it less often so it should last more years before it needs replacing anyway.####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '68,95', '99,109', '2'], ['Product Quality#Water Resistant', '439,449', '434,438', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '463,470', '474,498', '1'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '516,538', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '642,658', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '678,726', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '129,172', '-1,-1', '2']]

Yes you can fast charge it using a standard iPhone cable - I don't think it supports wireless charging (may be wrong, I don't have a wireless cradle) Hi, yes you can charge the phone normally. The phone doesn’t come with a charger due to keeping packaging down, but you can use an iPhone charger from an older iPhone or iPad. It’s a great phone, I love it.

Title: Ultra Power Saving mode Review: I am a traveller and often go on long treks and hence wanted a durable phone that also had long lasting battery life. I was going on a trek and the C11 is the only phone i took with me and i have to say i was very very impressed especially with the battery life. Generally during trek we don't get much access to plug ports hence i wanted a long battery life and the phone gave me just that, and when i turned on power saving mode was the best, this one week, i ran the phone without charging for 4 days.####[['Overall#Overall', '203,208', '248,267', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '288,300', '248,267', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '501,542', '-1,-1', '2']]

Yes the I phone I ordered is unlocked and a great buy. When I ordered the phone it said it was unlocked and small i had to do was Oder a SIM card from my provider, I did this and it was simple . Yes it’s unlocked Be careful with the charger though as mine overheated on the plug and stopped working the day after I got it Indeed, the phone comes like brand new, so you’ll need to make your own Apple ID or sign in to an existing account.

Just the mains charger, which can also be used to charge from a USB port on a laptop. I bought a hard case separately & a pack of tempered glass screen protectors, also from Amazon. They were very cheap & would recommend that buyers of the phone also get these to support use of the S9. Just a generic charger and cable. Just a heads up I was quoted on the high Street between ?220 and ?160 just to replace the screen on my Samsung galaxy s9 at the weekend!

Very decent quality phone. I really prefer to use Samsung A series phones rather than the s series. It's has got all the necessary technologies what you need in this time but in very reasonable and affordable price. It has face recognition, finger print scanner, NFC, multiple cameras, and last but not the least and the most important thing for me and for everyone for sure is he battery life, using my phone for almost 45 hours in one full charge, that includes watching videos most of the time, browsing Internet, Facebook, you tube.

I upgraded from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone XR too but my sim fitted perfectly. Try rotating the sim so it’ll fit in. The iPhone XR takes a nano sim or esim. I’d talk to your provider about getting a new sim and then see if you can transfer your number and contacts. Hope that helps! Yes - you need micro SIM - usually pops out of existing SIM card (plastic push out) I’m probably not the best person to ask this but a micro SIM card should be fine. If you can’t get that from your current SIM card then you may need to change it.####[]

I had this phone for all of a week. At that point it slipped out of my pocket while I was bending over and fell about a foot or 2 to the ground, with a screen protector on. The screen shattered right across the bottom of the phone. Waste of ?300 This phone has a fundamental design flaw - The screen glass, in addition to being very weak, curves right over the edges of the phone - this means that if it gets any kind of knock on the corners it puts the glass under stress. The screen protector cannot protect these parts of the screen (which are more likely to get knocked. I could only recommend this phone if kept in a fully immersive case else it's not going to last. The Pixel 3A was a far more robust model.####[['Screen#General', '177,183', '184,193', '0'], ['Screen#General', '293,305', '328,337', '0'], ['Product Quality#Fall Protection', '700,706', '695,699', '2']]
I needed a spare unlocked Android 8 phone that wasn't expensive and this seemed to fit the bill. It was ?39 when I bought it so the cheap box was ticked. Comes with Android 7 loaded but updates itself to Android 8.1 Go once hooked up to the internet. Pros Cheap. Dual nano sim slots which you can access without the thin metal spike that other phones use. Battery you can change yourself. Virtually no bloatware. Cons Only 2.4GHz wifi (no 5GHz wifi). Only 3G mobile (no 4G). Not much RAM so apps can be slow. Android 8.1 Go which some apps don't like. Summary As a spare phone this is great and the 2nd sim slot is handy. The limited RAM and cut down Android mean it isn't really sutiable for running apps.####[['System#Application', '402,411', '389,401', '0'], ['Signal#Wifi Signal', '423,434', '413,422', '0'], ['Signal#Wifi Signal', '439,448', '436,438', '0'], ['Signal#Signal of Mobile Network', '456,465', '451,455', '0'], ['Signal#Signal of Mobile Network', '470,472', '467,469', '0'], ['Product Configuration#Operating Memory', '484,487', '475,483', '0'], ['System#Application', '535,539', '540,550', '0'], ['System#Application', '491,495', '503,507', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '565,576', '585,590', '2'], ['Product Configuration#Operating Memory', '634,637', '626,633', '0'], ['System#System General', '651,658', '667,705', '0'], ['System#System Upgrade', '186,215', '-1,-1', '1']]

A great phone overall. It has a massive capacity battery so battery life on it is great. It isn't a phone that I pick up and use a huge amount as it is only for work and so on standby it rarely needs a charge at all! A decent amount of RAM, an 8 core processor and good storage capacity (which can be further extended) they makes the running and storage of apps and data very easy. A nice sharp screen with a good resolution. Quad rear cameras and 16MP front camera all capable of high clarity pictures and video. Overall a solid phone with tough durable cases and good features. For the price, this is faultless.####[['Product Accessories#Phone Cases', '555,560', '541,554', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '494,512', '466,493', '2'], ['Screen#Clarity', '389,401', '384,388', '2'], ['Product Configuration#Memory', '270,286', '265,269', '2'], ['Product Configuration#Operating Memory', '236,239', '217,235', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '194,215', '187,193', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '60,72', '82,87', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '49,56', '32,48', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '8,13', '2,7', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '8,13', '14,21', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#Pixel', '448,465', '-1,-1', '1'], ['Product Quality#General', '524,529', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '603,612', '-1,-1', '2']]

Assuming you need one at all, you would want a Micro SD card. These are good and fast. https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073JWXGNT The phone supports up to 1TB micro SD card which is higher storage than any of those, but I've had my phone since March and haven't used half the built in storage yet. If I bought one personally, it would be 200Gb or above for lots of wiggle room.

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AND DO NOT USE THIS SELLER!! I had only had this phone 3 weeks, with normal use. This phone over heated while charging. It was so hot that it burnt me to touch it. The screen is burnt, the charging port damaged and the seller won't do anything at all, says accidental damage isn't covered! This phone caught fire while on charge, using the correct charger in an ordinary in home plug socket!

Upgrade from S9+ so I wasn't sure how good they would be but things move on and so far the camera is way better but has a familiar feel and the screen is bright and clear , it does feel a bit plastic compared to the S9+ but once in the case I wont notice . I forgot to check if it had a headphone jack when I bought them and it does . Samsung to Samsung transfer is so simple and everything came over , you do have to backup WhatsApp separately and my photos are in the google cloud anyway .

Of course you can - you can on any fingerprint device. The device does not know who the fingerprints belong to so 10 different people could record their prints and all 10 could unlock the phone. If you are asking whether they get logged into their own personal 'account' on the phone (as some tablet devices do) then no it doesn't do that. Yes my husbands is set for him and myself.

Overall the product is good for normal usage. There is an issue with audio jack port manufacturing. I think testing is not done properly. As mentioned in the description audio jack 3.5 mm earphones available are doesn't fit well into the device port. It shows earphone connected symbol and no sound in earphone. If the earphone jack is pressed inwards then only sound will come in earphone.I checked this by replacing the item but same issue in both device.

Great phone so far upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 12 Pro Max, love everything about the phone, just dislike that the delivery guy tried to get one over on us with the phone. He was delivering the phone a case and a screen protector and he only gave me the screen protector and case and tried to get me to sign it as if he had given me the phone aswell, luckily enough I kicked off and he soon went to his van and got my phone on the passenger seat where it was and eventually give it me, I then signed that I’d received all my items.

It is just about ok. Too many silly menus and I hate not being able to have a flashing light for alerts. I do not like having to have an audible alert. The camera is not great. again lots of features but when you are taking a photo it shows a very dark image, you can of course change that within the settings but I like to be able to see what I am taking a photo of at the time.

there is a line that will be there due to the bend, you will see other lines in the video but it's because i took it out to repaste, which is caused by another issue: the camera hole wasnt completely cut out so it was dangling and I only noticed after pasting the top part.

Too bad it doesn't have an indicator light and the Bixby button which I used to quickly open an app with one tap on my S8, but it has other functions that my S8 doesn't so it evens out.

I bought two and they both worked on o2 and seemed to be unlocked. I obviously didn’t try any other networks but I had no issues. Yes... Mine was unlocked and was in mint condition. I ordered a 64g Mine was unlocked - I would have objected if it wasn't! Yes unlocked, just put my old SIM card in and worked, and I am still delighted with my purchase. It should be unlocked if it is able to accept almost all sims. If the phone is unlocked then it must be. Mine was unlocked. My iPhone worked on Vodafone sim so I would say yes.

Upgrading from a s8, this phone feels like a massive upgrade, which of course it is compared to a s8. Favorite things are the camera, 100x is mind blowingy good. The super slow mo on it is fun also. Screen image quality the 120hz refresh rate of the screen also. It's amazing if you like quirky cool things on your phone. If you want a phone to be just a phone, go for the s21 which is still packed full of most of these features camera is a little worse off, and no 120hz refresh.

I was on the market for a new phone and with everything costing like ?400+, I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this beauty for ?250.

Love this. However, it was sold as a 512gb memory version. It is not. Its 128. I believe the original ad has been amended now. Tried asking Amazon to honour the agreement but they would only say I could have a refund. Kept it anyway but make sure to check what you are buying.

I'm not sure what you mean, but I'll tell you as well as I can. It came with the Apple mark 13 OS, but it has since updated to 14, all by itself. If you mean App software, I believe that is unlimited, although I'm unlikely to ever get beyond very elementary, as you may have deduced from my poor knowledge of the relevant OS nomenclature. My Apple iphone 7plus is regularly updated by Apple and the current version is iOS 14.2 iOS 14.2 which will update to 14.3. Currently being used iOS 14.2####[]

Only had the phone for a few weeks( a replacement for the wife's old 5SE, which was suffering with it's battery). Seems to be pretty good at the moment, moderate use mainlt texts and calls, not too much internet use, but last about 4 days. Apple phone batteries are one of their problems according to Which, but this is ok for moment, old one was charging virtually every day 10-13 hours. 40 hours audio playback.

This phone is encased in rubber and waterproof, including all ports which have a sort of pop out cover. (The screen is toughened glass according to manufacturers description). Therefore it is great for sailors, ramblers, climbers, gardeners and also those who might be accident-prone due to fine motor control issues (e.g. arthritis, teenagers, dyspraxia). The phone matches the description in the advert, as far as I can tell. The fingerprint reader does not work reliably for me, but the phone actually tells you that it is quite new tech so not to expect high reliability. I do not use the facial recognition reader function so cannot assess it.

The phone pouch is too small and barely fits an iPhone 12 in a case. Same story with the key pocket. The straps allow to adjust fit from loose to tight, but a loose fit means discomfort while running, and a tight fit, even though feels much better, causes more sweating by keeping your shirt very tight to the body.####[]

It is, but it's confusing - at first it looks like a single SIM tray, but it actually takes two, one on top and one underneath. Not like the old Samsung phones that had a double length tray. This answer applies to the UK phones where Amazon is the seller. Other sellers might be selling imported phones with different SIM arrangements. I can tell you for sure it is not dual nano sims. It uses single nano sim and no longer supports micro sd memory cards or any memory cards. No it only takes one micro sim It does.####[]

Phones are a personal thing and we all want something different. I was looking for quality and value, that's what I got! An amazing battery that has me charge my phone about every 3 days. A year after getting this phone and I still hardly charge it. Camera and performance have been excellent considering the price of this phone compared to flagship models. The M range is better value than the A range easily available to me on the UK High Street. I will be considering the M range when looking for my next phone. I like mobile phones and usually change handsets every 2 years, I could easily see myself keeping this phone longer. No problems after a year, Samsung in my experience make quality handsets (I've bought loads). Performance, Value, Battery Life and all things considered 5/5. A great mid-range effort from Samsung.####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '132,139', '124,131', '2'], ['Performance#General', '726,737', '785,788', '2'], ['Price#Price', '739,744', '785,788', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '746,758', '785,788', '2'], ['Performance#General', '261,272', '283,292', '2'], ['Camera#General', '250,256', '283,292', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '362,369', '373,385', '2']]

Because like most things the item's not actually being sold by Amazon. There hidden in the red tape is the fact that its not eligible for cash back, as the company actually selling it has not signed up for the scheme.

This is my third straight Samsung Galaxy phone, upgrading most recently from the A5 which was amazing for the price. But with the A52, you get what you pay for. After just over a month of standard usage, the flashlight suddenly stopped working. It's a hardware problem, and so a repair is the only way to fix it. Samsung says their warranty will cover it... if you send your phone back to them for repair which can take up to 10 days! Who can go without a phone for 10 days? On site repairs aren't free, so now I am paying to have THEIR DEFECTIVE PHONE fixed. What a waste of my time and money. Avoid this phone like the plague.####[['Price#Price', '110,115', '94,101', '0'], ['Camera#Fill light', '208,218', '219,243', '0'], ['After-sales Service#Exchange/Warranty/Return', '475,490', '491,502', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '547,552', '537,546', '0'], ['After-sales Service#Exchange/Warranty/Return', '365,404', '415,433', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '567,593', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '595,627', '-1,-1', '0']]

I thought I'd get this phone to replace my old Samsung. Everything transferred ok and I quite impressed. However, when I installed a memory card, it formatted ok and then couldn't see it. I've changed cards but still none are seen. Also I'm now having a problem charging the phone. After 24 hours on charge it's only at 45 percent. There is probably a simple solution but I've not had chance to find out yet.

I've had HTCs, Pixel, Pixel 3a, iPhone 6, and this is (hands down) the best phone I've ever had. And for the price, if it only lasted one year, it would still be good value. It's fast, the graphics are great, the GUI is slick, and the finger ID is efficient. And after my first day of playing with it, updating everything, downloading everything, the battery was down to 50% at bed time. Would probably last about 3 days with minimal use (calls and texts).####[['Overall#Overall', '76,81', '71,75', '2'], ['Price#Value for Money', '167,172', '153,166', '2'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '189,197', '202,207', '2'], ['System#UI Interface Aesthetics', '213,216', '220,225', '2'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '235,244', '248,257', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '394,437', '-1,-1', '2']]

The seller promised good battery life. The reality is less than 20 hrs, without using the phone, ie in standby. My last phone, an Aldi rugged using an older version of the same software, would go 3 weeks between charges, and was only retired after 5 years as the battery bulged. I expected about a week from a charge on the Alcatel, given that the battery is 400mAh compared to the 1700mAh of the Aldi phone. The seller description does promote long battery life.

I think you can have only pin . I have fingerprint and pin All 3 it's good mobile ...for money and beats some big time ones I'm very happy with it Yes, you can use a pin or shape as well. I have had mine since December and still very happy with it. Can set to pin as well Yes it does have a fingerprint scanner Theres no code entry but it has pattern entry as well as face recognition and fingerprint. I am loving it. Fast response and very long battery life You do not need finger print or face.

Galaxy S21 features wireless support for Samsung DeX on PC. Previously, you could only run DeX for PC with a wired connection between your Galaxy device and your PC. However, the Galaxy S21 supports running DeX for PC wirelessly, so long as both your PC and your phone are on the same wireless network. Samsung DeX certainly is a feature with our S21 and has some new improvements to seamlessly connect your Samsung devices! Open multiple separate DeX windows on your PC, connect to nearby TVs to watch a movie on the big screen, or create a virtual classroom for the kids; you have simultaneous access to both devices with wireless connections for maximum efficiency and convenience. ^LP at Samsung Support Yes the S21 5G supports wired and wireless DeX, you will need to download the app.####[['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '20,28', '29,36', '2'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '207,228', '190,206', '2'], ['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '384,402', '368,383', '2']]

"Light" version of last years top of the range model provides a very high spec at a reasonable price. The battery is not user removable so its life will be critical compared to my previous phone but most phones are going this way now. It follows the other trend of being a bit bigger than older phones.

I am clumsy clutz so used to drop my phones a lot and average age of a mobile in my hand was about 1 to 2 year max. So i always used to go for cheap chinese phones than high end expensive phones as i do know i will be replacing them in a year . So Blackview with its robust build appealed to me but i am not satisfied with the performance of the phone. My cheaper chinese phones used to give better user experience and performance[ at lower cost,by 100 GBP] But it does what it promises to do i had dropped the phone already and there is no scratch. But i would have been happier with cheaper phone which i would have replaced in a year.[ The sturdy build is not enough to tempt me ]####[['Overall#Overall', '143,163', '136,142', '2'], ['Performance#General', '327,338', '304,322', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '356,378', '387,430', '2'], ['Price#Price', '441,445', '435,440', '2'], ['Product Quality#Fall Protection', '499,524', '538,548', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Workmanship and Texture', '643,655', '659,681', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '585,598', '567,584', '2']]

If I could give this no stars I would. The slowest phone created, throws you out of apps (many apps built in and can't be deleted) and unresponsive. Won't support chat heads for social media due to conserving battery life and struggles to get wifi/mobile data when no issues with any other phone. Fully charging the battery took around 4 hours and only lasted 12 hours with minimal use. Spare yourself and do not buy this phone. I've purchased other blackview phones in the past, all with no issues, unfortunately after my experience I won't be using them again. Phone lasted less than a month before it stopped charging properly. 3 and a half hours to reach 10%. Thankfully I've been offered a full refund once sent back.####[['System#Application', '90,108', '113,129', '0'], ['Signal#Wifi Signal', '243,247', '226,242', '0'], ['Signal#Signal of Mobile Network', '248,259', '226,242', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '353,385', '348,352', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '450,466', '484,498', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '612,629', '604,611', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '297,323', '324,343', '0'], ['Buyer Attitude#Recommendable', '406,416', '-1,-1', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '631,662', '-1,-1', '0']]

Title: Best for school work Review: My main requirements from a phone were: 1. Big battery 2. Bright colorful display 3. Good performance 4. Affordable price The C11 2021 gave me the best choice in all of these at the price i wanted, the 5000mAh battery lasts for days, in fact i think it is realme phones OS and battery features that are the reason for this long life. The Charging on this is also good enough, and since the battery is so big i don't need to charge so many times, just one charge can lasts for many days sometimes. The display is also one of the biggest i ever saw in a phone, it is great for you tube, and to watch movies in Jio app.####[['Performance#General', '126,137', '121,125', '2'], ['Screen#General', '110,117', '94,109', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '83,90', '79,82', '2'], ['Price#Price', '152,157', '141,151', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '238,253', '254,268', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '374,382', '394,410', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '426,433', '437,443', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '446,466', '467,480', '2'], ['Screen#Size', '537,544', '548,571', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '487,531', '-1,-1', '2']]

Really this should be a 4 star review but there are 2 points that loose it stars. 1) The bluetooth audio connectivity has occasional brief hiccups (looses 1 star) 2) The phone has a factory installed "Basic Service" App, with this App installed the phone would get a 1 star review as this App tries to save a small amount of memory and battery power (Not needed on a phone with 8Gb Ram and 10,000 mAh battery), in doing so it adds annoying popups and makes various Apps unusable as it kills them off after 10 minutes of the screen locked. Luckily if you know what you are doing you can de-install it to get a usable phone and thus looses another star for that fact you have to de-install this App.####[['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '89,117', '122,146', '0'], ['System#Application', '182,219', '302,349', '2'], ['System#Application', '182,219', '426,478', '0'], ['Product Configuration#Operating Memory', '378,385', '-1,-1', '1'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '390,408', '-1,-1', '1']]

Having clung desperately to my s7edge for years, I despaired of finding a suitable replacement for not an exorbitant cost, and then I happened upon this little gem that has taken me less than 24 hours to fall in love with. Whilst I realise a s7edge isn't a mega comparison, this ~?200 fone is blisteringly fast with a bit of a whopper of a battery, too. In addition, because this is a fone aimed at gamers, there's an enormous amount of tweaking possible If you want a fast fone with a low price, this is absolutely brilliant. ?####[['Performance#Running Speed', '306,310', '293,305', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '340,347', '316,337', '2'], ['Price#Price', '490,495', '486,489', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '516,525', '505,515', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '212,216', '-1,-1', '2']]

Hugely impressed with what you can get for less than ?250 these days. My eyes were getting a bit too old for my iPhone se 2020 and it's small screen so I swapped for this large screen phone expecting to see a big dip in performance and camera etc. Have to say that in many ways it is proving to be a much better device. Screen is excellent, battery life very solid (and much better than the SE!), has a headphone jack!! The camera is the first try budget camera I've been really impressed by. The Pixel 4a has a great main camera, but for me a poor selfie camera. This phone is great all round. The device looks good and is so far performing perfectly well. Very happy.####[['Screen#Size', '142,148', '136,141', '0'], ['Screen#Size', '177,183', '171,176', '2'], ['Performance#General', '220,231', '209,216', '0'], ['Camera#General', '236,242', '209,216', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '312,318', '300,311', '2'], ['Screen#General', '320,326', '330,339', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '341,353', '354,364', '2'], ['Camera#General', '455,461', '444,454', '0'], ['Camera#General', '455,461', '467,491', '0'], ['Camera#General', '518,529', '512,517', '2'], ['Camera#General', '549,562', '544,548', '0'], ['Performance#General', '631,641', '642,656', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '578,593', '-1,-1', '2']]

Great so far, after having it for a week. I previously had the Iphone X which died a death on me, hence the new phone. I was concerned about getting used to the smaller size, but I had had enough of the ever growing phones that Apple were producing (not clutch bag friendly, I tell you!). It didn't take me more than an hour or so to get used to the smaller size. Unlike older iPhones, whilst its smaller, you don't notice so much as it's a full screen these days. Battery life seems great so far, but I do use my phone LOTS for apps etc. and I noticed my Iphone X deteriorated fairly quickly, let's hope this one continues to be reliable - first impressions are that it's good though. Also, a completely non-technical comment - I LOVE THE PURPLE :)####[['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '169,173', '250,273', '0'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '358,362', '350,357', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '465,477', '484,489', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '556,564', '565,592', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '641,658', '673,677', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Color', '740,746', '731,735', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '0,5', '-1,-1', '2']]

Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough.

After 3 months this should be taken up with the person or company from whom it was purchased; they have to issue a refund or repacement if the device is faulty or not fit for purpose (They then pass it back to who they bought the thing from and so on). This is the Law (Google 'Sale of Goods Act 1979' and see the government guidance). If you encounter any problems or reluctance with the seller ask amazon to act as an intermediary to secure your refund/replacement. Your contract of sale is with the vendor. Likely Amazon in this case. You could contact their customer services or alternatively Xiaomi UK directly via their website.####[['Overall#Overall', '143,149', '153,182', '0']]

This is OK but it is just a bigger phone with different cameras. It is exactly the same as my S8 plus, so for the price I think it is way too expensive. And the battery life is not as good as I thought. I would recommend that you buy a good case and camera lens cover, as the camera lenses do stand out a bit. Is it worth the hefty price, simple answer is NO, the face recognition and fingerprint reader work. But there is no headphone socket, and you can not install a micro sd card to boost the storage.####[['Camera#General', '56,63', '46,55', '2'], ['Price#Price', '142,151', '138,141', '0'], ['Product Packaging#General', '241,245', '236,240', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '161,173', '177,201', '0'], ['Price#Price', '332,337', '326,331', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '28,34', '-1,-1', '2']]

As far as I’m aware the phone itself is 100% Apple. When I got it, I only got a 3rd party charging cable and no charging plug which wasn’t very good. Yes it was a complete phone with all parts .

Love the phone. It replaces my iPhone 6 so I notice a big improvement. The camera is fantastic, I love face recognition which is so much quicker than using a fingerprint. It’s just the right size for me as I’m no fan of big phones. It’s fast & having also bought air pods I’ve started using Siri which I find much more responsive than Alexa. My only slight disappointment is battery life which is adequate for a day’s moderate use but I would prefer it to do better when new as batteries always deteriorate over time & I tend to keep my phones for several years. Also I feel that the lack of a charger plug is a bit mean considering the price.####[['Overall#Overall', '9,14', '0,4', '2'], ['Camera#General', '75,81', '85,94', '2'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '103,119', '98,102', '2'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '103,119', '129,149', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Fuselage Size', '191,195', '176,190', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '220,230', '210,219', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '375,387', '345,371', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '478,487', '488,516', '0'], ['Product Accessories#Charger', '594,606', '584,591', '0'], ['Product Accessories#Charger', '594,606', '610,620', '0'], ['Intelligent Assistant#Intelligent Assistant General', '291,295', '309,340', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Standby Time', '397,430', '-1,-1', '0']]

Phone freeze does not work without head phone now all apps are malfunctioning. Looks like I was sent a bad phone. From day 1 it came with NO HEAD PHONES. I could not hear any person with head phones. I had to set it up to be on hands free. I rebooted it with software updates then it worked for a couple of days. then it would kick of again with the same problem. Now I cannot even use the phone again as all apps are mal functioning. I would like you to kindly let me know how you want to resolve this issue? Is it a software issue or just a lemon phone I got or is it a refund of the phone with refund of my money?

I bought the Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra black, however I received the cosmic grey. Also, all the phone corners have some marks as if this had been opened and there is some dirty on top of the screen. Furthermore, I charged the phone, turn it on and less than 3 hours the battery was reduced to 40%, because that, I'm returning this phone.

I like the phone itself, it feels solid and performs well, cameras are good, didn't realise when I bought it that I couldn't use a second sim and a micro sd card, minor irritation. My old phone A8, the fingerprint reader was excellent as it was on the back of the phone and I never had a problem with it. The A52 fails to recognise my fingerprint more times than it recognises it. The Micro sd card slot was my main reason for buying this phone and not the latest S20 or S21 as Samsung, for some bizarre reason has discontinued fitting this option to it's more expensive models.####[['Overall#Overall', '11,16', '2,6', '2'], ['Performance#General', '44,52', '53,57', '2'], ['Camera#General', '59,66', '71,75', '2'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '202,220', '225,234', '2'], ['Security#Screen Unlock', '335,346', '313,331', '0'], ['Product Quality#General', '34,39', '-1,-1', '2']]

FINGERPRINT SENSOR - Fingerprint sensor not always awake ( even if always on display enabled ) You have to push power button many instances to fingerprint sensor appear. BATTERY - I'm a heavy user still left 10% at the end of day, no complaints at all about battery####[['Camera#General', '9,15', '19,36', '0'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '100,105', '106,148', '0'], ['System#Lock Screen Design', '171,189', '190,206', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Capacity', '320,327', '347,379', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#General', '408,415', '381,407', '2']]
