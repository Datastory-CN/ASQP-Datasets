I replaced my Galaxy A40 with the A52 G5. The description of the phone ticked all the boxes and it's great apart from the fingerprint reader and facial recognition. The log-in process is very hit and miss and it's very frustrating especially when using the phone for walking apps. I've tried all the suggested fixes offered but I guess a software update is required.####[['Overall#Overall', '65,70', '101,106', '2']]

Decided to buy a refurbished S9 from here, rather than take pot-luck on a second hand one from Ebay. Wasn't dissapointed, item is virtually "as new" and was competatively priced compared to aformentioned second hand models. As per the description, it came with a lead and a generic plug in USB charger, rather than a dedicated Samsung one. But it was perfectly adequate. Overall, really happy.####[['Price#Price', '171,177', '157,170', '2']]

I had previously owned a Samsung S series phone and so when I decided to buy a new phone I decided to get the S21 Ultra. However, the features of the phone don't justify the cost. The cameras ( the main reason for buying it) are full of gimmicky features, none of which produce that great photos. The main camera is ok for general shots and the zoom feature is great for up to 30x zoom. However, the colours are too vibrant and not realistic. In particular, blue skies come out too blue. If I am going to pay this much money, I expect far higher quality photographic imaging. I returned the phone to Amazon, but didn't get any refund as they said that the package was empty upon arrival. I have now bought the Samsung A52 from Currys. The phone is just as good, but a third of the price of the S21 Ultra.####[['Price#Value for Money', '134,155', '156,178', '0'], ['Camera#General', '184,191', '229,254', '0'], ['Camera#General', '184,191', '256,295', '0'], ['After-sales Service#Exchange/Warranty/Return', '578,606', '612,633', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '739,744', '748,760', '2'], ['Camera#General', '301,312', '400,441', '0'], ['Camera#General', '301,312', '316,336', '2']]

The battery on this phone dies in less than a day even when not in use. This makes it useless as a "mobile" phone. I suspect that the software is draining the battery behind the scenes or there is a power drain in the electronics. The manual print is tiny. Not ideal for an older person. The instructions are also vague and may even be for another model.

I need a cheap phone when my daily driver suddenly died. I opted for this as the reviews looked good and seena few reviews and thought I would take a chance. I lasted a Day of using it before i put it back in its box and returned it. Slow is an understatement its painful to use. Blue tooth is ropey at best. Not hotspot so could not connect my car stereo to use Waze or other Wifi apps. Typing on the keyboard causes as much pain as licking razor blades. It was soo unresposice and the accuracy was sloppy at best., Honestly stay awy from this phone.####[['Smart Connect#Bluetooth Connection', '280,290', '294,307', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '545,550', '517,539', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '264,278', '-1,-1', '0']]

I love this phone I tried many in the past and always gone back to iPhone as I couldn’t find one that came close quality performance wise and what it can do, this one is fab I actually bought it for camera as a 2nd phone but I am considering using it as my main phone instead of iPhone it’s that good. Very happy with it battery life is great I play games on it watch YouTube stuff lasts ages. Got more news content if that’s your thing and you can customise it to only show what you like too! Even came with a case which I was surprised considering the fab price! my only worry is the usb cable for charging it where I can get them from as easily as the iPhone ones as the iPhone cable are sold cheaply in many shops maybe that’s why they don’t last two minutes even the official apple ones.

Tried to set it up for him  for someone used to a smart phone this was not even going back to steam powered it was stone age. Nothing about it is simple. It almost ended up back in the box several times. Instructions , what there is off them are as clear as mud. And it is not even very loud. His old phone is just as loud and it has not got the option to put onto speaker, or i have not found it. Sending a text is a long winded affair.

It compares in the same way a food-mixer compares to a refrigirator (both kitchen appliances). Both the Samsung and the Xiomi are mobile phones. What more do you want and expect. Do some research online or possibly instore. What is your price range? What spec. do you need. What is it's primary use going to be? Is it for gaming, communication, listening to music watching online content? Aer you bothered about named brand. So many different comparisons and only you can make the right choice for you.

I am on different work calls the entire day and the one thing that pisses me off is the seriously flawed proximity sensor.

Loved the colour, size and the fact that it came with a clear cover and screen protector. It's also pretty easy to use. But the camera? What can I say about that? Nothing complimentary, that's for sure. I always said a mobile phone is for phoning but when you get these phones with the cameras "bigged up" you EXPECT to get something DECENT. Well, sorry. I don't care WHAT the specs say. There is NO WAY that's a 13mp camera. And it's supposed to be a TRIPLE? Yeah, in their dreams.

The phone seems fine to a certain point. The main problem i have is there is no user guide at all. So a lot of the functions on this phone are probably useless as you can't figure out how they work properly. Might sound stupid but not had smart phones long.

Pros: Battery backup is good. Rear Camera is good. Front camera is average. Image processing could be way better. Display clarity is good. Processing is ok for moderate to high end users. Cons: Don't forget to insure the product for screen replacement. Bcoz the display is very fragile. After 8 months of usage, touch screen stopped working unexpectedly while operating the phone. Lags very often if you don't have space left or you have not restarted for a long time. Front camera image processing not that much great. One advice if you are purchasing, extend your warranty by visiting service center or calling call center before it expires####[['Battery/Longevity#General', '6,20', '24,28', '2'], ['Camera#Rear Camera', '30,41', '45,49', '2'], ['Camera#Front Camera', '51,63', '67,74', '1'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '76,92', '93,112', '0'], ['Screen#Clarity', '114,129', '133,137', '2'], ['Screen#General', '262,269', '273,285', '0'], ['Screen#General', '312,324', '325,353', '0'], ['Signal#Signal General', '381,385', '386,396', '0'], ['Shooting Functions#General', '469,498', '499,518', '0']]

The phone is working well so far. I have used only a few apps on it so far, but everything works without a problem. After moderate use, the battery lasts for more than 48 hours.

The iPhone SE 2020 is a spectacular phone but it does have it's faults. If you are looking to buy this phone then you should know that the battery health does go down quite quickly and it takes quite sometime to charge (I've had this phone for 9 months). Another thing that I am a bit annoyed about is how many scratches it gets I'm not sure if that is just me or the phone, but then again I have dropped down a flight of stairs twice and it hasn't cracked the screen so I'm very grateful for that.

First of all I was disappointed by the negative reviews of this phone on Amazon and YouTube and anyways I decided to go with this phone. The main pros of this phone is the lightweight and slim body that best fits in your hand and pockekets.And secondly the screen quality is superb.And battery life is decent enough to give a days power in a single charge.This phone is for normal users like me and for people who play a lot of games and use their phone 24/7 I don't recommend this phone.I play COC and COD on weekends and this pretty much handle the gaming.The main reason I buy this other than other cheaper phones like Mi or realme is because of the user experience i,e the Oxygen OS wich is the best UI in any of the Android smartphones.You can go with this phone without a second consideration.You have my word.####[['System#UI Interface Aesthetics', '704,706', '699,703', '2'], ['Screen#General', '257,271', '275,281', '2'], ['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '286,298', '302,355', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Weight', '172,183', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Appearance Design#Thickness', '188,197', '-1,-1', '2'], ['Price#Price', '602,609', '-1,-1', '2']]

I got this model as not only was it not too expensive, but it also had a fairly good amount of space so I can have a few apps for work as well as some personal ones. The battery also lasts quite a while, so much better than my old phone. Putting in the sim card was quick and easy. The only issue which isn't really a big deal - is how big it is compared to my old phone, but once I got familiar with that, it is perfect. Also missing the fingerprint log in function but it is something you can live without.

I had no trouble connecting my phone to my wifi. Are you sure you are entering in the password exactly? Remember that upper and lower case letters must be entered exactly. Hi there. First of all, we’d recommend ensuring that the password is correct for the Wi-Fi, usually it is placed on a small card and handed to you to keep safe. If the password is still wrong, then please contact the network provider. ^HA at Samsung Support Go to Settings. Make sure you enter the Wireless Password/key, not the Wireless Network Name.

Brilliant value for money. Fast and effective use of WiFi and fantastic colours. Easy to use. Bought for an adult with learning difficulties.

Great little phone otherwise. He plays games and Google stuff all the time on it. Would be excellent for kids I reckon, as they wouldn't be able to access porn either!!

First of all this is a replacement to my iPhone XR which had many faults. I really like the new iPhone and it works much better than its predecessor. It includes features like live wallpapers and real Haptic Touch and my favourite double camera. If you want an iPhone that is amazing for a good price get the new SE or the XR (Mine was a one off I presume) but if you have more money to spend buy the IPhone 11 or up.

No the iPhone 7 came all complete with battery installed, charger etc, it was 128 GB model and I paid ?210. If it had been refurbished I could not tell 12 months of daily use and battery still shows 100% capacity. Hope this helps The refurbished iPhone 7 that I bought is 4 years old and has a perfectly good battery, so I I saw no reason to replace it. In fact, this replaced an old iPhone 5s, which still had the original battery. If I am not mistaken, Apple say that a battery should be good for 500 charge / discharge cycles When my phone came my battery health was at 100% so I assume they do Hi there, I recently bought a reconditioned iPhone from Amazon which was complete with battery and have never heard of Amazon selling an iPhone without one.

This is certainly not expected behaviour with our Galaxy A52 5G! We would recommend performing a Soft reset by pressing and holding the Volume Down and Power button at the same time until your phone reboots, then check for any software updates through Settings > Software update > Download and install. If the display issue continues, please don't hesitate to contact our Support Team through the 'Support' page on our Samsung UK website.

The S21 Ultra is my second return to Samsung in the last five years. The first being the Note 20 Ultra that only lasted a week due to poor battery life in comparison to the OnePlus 8 Pro as clearly the chipset was lacking; however the S21 Ultra is a different beast and on this occasion Samsung have got it spot on. The lack of fast charging in less than an hour and no charger in the box are the only flaws I have found thus far. Truly impressed with Samsung's effort this time around. Split screen plus watching Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime is very pleasing on this device as the audio is spot on. Bixby Routines is a must for every phone and I can only hope this feature develops more each build. Simply put, if you can afford it, get it as you won't be disappointed.####[['Battery/Longevity#Battery Life', '139,151', '134,138', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Power Consumption Speed', '108,119', '120,126', '0'], ['Battery/Longevity#Charging Speed', '328,341', '342,362', '2'], ['Product Accessories#Charger', '367,388', '397,407', '0'], ['Overall#Overall', '573,579', '551,564', '2'], ['Audio/Sound#Volume and Speaker', '587,592', '596,603', '2'], ['Overall#Overall', '762,774', '753,758', '2']]
